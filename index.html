                Fear is the word we use to describe our emotional reaction to something that seems dangerous. But the word "fear" is used in another way, too: to name something a person often feels afraid of.

                    A goal is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a group of people envision, plan and commit to achieve. A goal is roughly similar to a purpose or aim, the anticipated result which guides reaction.
